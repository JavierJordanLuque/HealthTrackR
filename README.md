# HealthTrackR

HealthTrackR: A comprehensive healthcare treatment tracking app for Android Devices. Final degree project (TFG) of the Software Engineering degree at the University of Malaga (UMA), authored by Javier Jord√°n Luque.

Within the repository's structure, you'll find two primary directories thoughtfully organizing the project's components. Firstly, the "HealthTrackR" folder houses the complete Android Studio project, including its codebase, resources, and configurations. Secondly, the "docs" directory serves as a central hub for all project documentation, crafted in Spanish.

This documentation covers various crucial aspects of the project, such as the project report, requirements documentation, and detailed use case descriptions. It also includes a variety of diagrams, such as use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams, providing comprehensive insights into the project's architecture and functionalities. Additionally, mockups of the user interface design are readily available for reference.

Moreover, the repository maintains all versions of every document, allowing for transparency and facilitating an understanding of the project's evolution over time.
